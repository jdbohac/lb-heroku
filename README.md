# LAN-Buddy Back-end repository

This is the production build of LAN-Buddy, a platform to connect gamers with others that match their skill level and availability.  

This API was built using Django REST framework and a PostgreSQL database. 

The backend includes a back-end search filter and many-to-one relational tables.

The deployed version of the app is [available here](https://lanbuddy.herokuapp.com/)
